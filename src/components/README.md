# :bricks: Components

The **Components** folder contains modular blocks of code that can be reused in various sections of the application.

## :thinking: Understanding structure

Each subfolder represents a group of components that serve a specific purpose. Here's an example:

```
Components
├── inputs
│   ├── listInput
|   │   ├── index.tsx
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

In this example, the `inputs` folder contains reusable input components.

**NOTE**: By convention, all components should have the word 'Component' at the end of their name. In the example provided, the component would be named as `ListInputComponent`.
